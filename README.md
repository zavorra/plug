# Plug

This ([[GitHub](https://github.com/zavorra/plug)] ) is a fork of [Offa's fork](https://github.com/offa/plug)] of [piorekf's Plug](https://bitbucket.org/piorekf/plug/).

My goal is to add support for Mustang V2 I/II effects and amps.

## Goals

- Port to *Modern C++*
- Port to Qt5
- CMake support
- Modernization and Improvements
- Unit Test Suite
- Moving to Git


## Requirements

- [**CMake**](https://www.cmake.org/)
- [**Qt5**](https://www.qt.io/)
- [**libusb-1.0**](http://libusb.info/)



## Building

Building and Testing is done through CMake:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make unittest
```


## Installation

CMake will install the application and *udev* rule (`50-mustang.rules`) using:

```
make install
```

The *udev* rule allows the USB access without *root* for the users of the `plugdev` group.
